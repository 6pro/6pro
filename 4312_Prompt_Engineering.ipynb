        "Prompt engineering is a crucial skill in the era of large language models (LLMs). Just as data scientists need clean data for analysis, AI practitioners need well-crafted prompts to get optimal results from LLMs. This skill involves understanding how to effectively communicate with AI models to achieve desired outcomes, whether it's generating code, analyzing text, or solving complex problems.\n",
        "In this tutorial, we'll learn how to craft effective prompts using the OpenAI API. We'll explore various techniques from basic prompting to advanced methods like chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot learning. While these examples won't cover every possible prompting technique, they'll provide you with a solid foundation for developing your own prompting strategies. We'll focus on two main approaches: direct prompting and context-enhanced prompting.\n",
